the 'w' and 'k' in 'work' are both on layer 2, and they follow each other in quick succession. A challenge to mitigate, as 'w' is in a great spot, and I don't know how to put 'k' on the home layer.
same for 'by'. the 'b' and 'y' are on the same layer, and they follow each other immediately. 
Decision to try to rectify: move 'v' to layer 2 and bring 'y' to the front.

The 'ck' issue
- Here's the thing about the second layer: ideally, for bigrams such as 'by', 'ck', you always want to be able to tap that one-shot layer on 'c' or 'b', not the other way around.
- There is tangible friction when trying to find a way to roll through 'c' and then 'k' with a thumb key press inbetween... Yes, that's what I'm trying to say. 'thumb-key press' + 'c' + 'k' is 1000x better than 'c' + 'thumb-key press' + 'k'
- Then there's the issue of 'cd', which is a command that would slow me down a lot if I 1) moved 'c' and 'd' to different rows, or 2) move 'c' or 'd' to a different layer. Not sustainable. But that's not to say that we can't have more than one 'c' or 'd' on my board, dispersed accross layers.
- A great example / success story of this is the 'au' issue that was solved by the 2 alpha layers. As I type, I see the 'au' on the horizon, and as it reaches my cursor I tap my thumb-key and roll over what would have been 'ou', swapping out 'o' with 'a'.
- There's also an issue I'm facing now with 'eo' ('theory', 'someone', 'erroneous'). This is one of the most noticable points of friction with MTGAP - The 'EO' bygram. MTGAP has 'E' on the left middle-finger homerow position, where 'O' is positioned one key above that - the middle finger position one row above the home row.

'Backwards' - too many thumb-key presses.

This keyboard rabbit role is deep. Very deep. 
Ultimately I feel that it's a dance between efficiency, flow, optimization and comfort, in a tug of war against finitude, limitation, and scarcity. As much as I try and regardless of how much I think about it in my head, it always comes down to a compromise between efficiency and genuine limitation.
A compromise and a tug of war between sheer, raw speed and physical limitation.

The reality is quite simply that I only have ten fingers - four of which sit on the home row, and two of which should, in a perfect world, only have one key designated to them - the pinkies. The pinkie fingers move fastest and are at theor most comfortable when they are not moving up and down like the index, middle and ring fingers can. Must in my layout, they just do, because I'm sacrificing on speed, and, and, and, and... Tradeoffs. Compromise.

So let's map this out. 

In a perfect world, in my view, exists a 22-key keyboard. 
Two of those keys are thumb keys. One is spacebar. The other is a one-shot shift.
That leaves us with twenty keys for the fingers. Each hand is responsible for ten. The index, middle and ring fingers have only three keys designated to them - one on the homerow, one above the homerow, one below the homerow. The pinkies have only one key assigned to them. 
This is a perfect keyboard layout. It acknowledges the reality that I have eight fingers and two thumbs. 

Then comes physical limitations and finitude itself. Reality may indeed be infinite, but true infinity includes finitude itself.

Here's a list of hard knock realities that get in the way of this keyboard:
- There are 26 letters in the alphabet. Already too many to designate to our fingers.
- Punctuation is as common as the vowels. So really we could say there are at minimum 30 keys we need to use to navigate a keyboard and write.
- Naturally then, we are forced to do one of two things: increase the number of keys on the board, or split the keys into multiple layers.
- If we choose option A) we ultimately retreat and sacrifice the ultimate ergonomic comfort and sensibility for physical limitations. If we choose option B) we are now faced with the decision of which key is going on the chopping block to free up space for that second layer. 
- In a Game of Thrones / hunger games fashion, a wise move given this standoff would be to sacrifice one-shot shift on the thumb key, replacing it with a one-shot layer shift. Or, we could increase our thumb keys from two to four.

This keyboard rabbit hole has been an incredibly exciting, enlightening and overwhelming journey. I am determined that I will crack this tango. I will, over years, continue to push the frontlines of sheer raw speed and comfort. 10 / 10
